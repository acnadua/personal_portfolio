# Personal Website: Abigail Nadua

Get to know me through this website! It also includes a list of my skills and some of my previous projects. Got interested? You may contact me via the linked social media sites or send a message directly through the website!

### Disclaimer:

I am NOT a UI designer, I could only implement what's already given so creating this web page by myself is challenging. Therefore, I watched and followed a tutorial from PedroTech, whose tutorial is linked below! I used it for inspiration and to get my web page creation process started because I could not, for the love of me, think of a theme that suits me best.
